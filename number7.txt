Stemming is like chopping a mushroom's stem from its cap, so that we could eat the edible part
In NLP, stemming is cutting the inflections(imbuhan) and keep the main essence of the word

Lemmatization also tries to remove inflections  carefully, unlike stemming, lemmatization
doest not simply chop off inflections but relies lexical knowledge base.

Is it possible to perfrom stemming using NLTK? Yes.

from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer
from nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize, word_tokenize
 
words = ["game","gaming","gamed","games"]
ps = PorterStemmer()
 
for word in words:
    print(ps.stem(word))
